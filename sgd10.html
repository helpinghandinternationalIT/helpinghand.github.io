              According to UNDP SDGs, income inequality is on the rise—the richest 10 percent have up to 40 percent of
              global income whereas the poorest 10 percent earn only between 2 to 7 percent. If we take into account
              population growth inequality in developing countries, inequality has increased by 11 percent.
              Income inequality has increased in nearly everywhere in recent decades, but at different speeds. These
              widening disparities require sound policies to empower lower income earners, and promote economic inclusion
              of all regardless of sex, race or ethnicity.

            Income inequality requires global solutions. This involves improving the regulation and monitoring of financial
            markets and institutions, encouraging development assistance and foreign direct investment to regions where the need
            is greatest. Facilitating the safe migration and mobility of people is also key to bridging the widening divide.

            <p>Helping Hand International believes that empowerment of women can bring a positive attitudinal change in the
              world. So HHI is actively working in empowering women through all means. From the starting of the organisation
              HHI has always believed in the competency of women and that's the reason that more than 85% of the members are
              women in HHI. We have women as the president in most of the branches of HHI. We strongly believe in the capacity
              of the women and hence most of the webinar of HHI are led by girls. Even women are always given the first
              preference in all the important committees of Helping Hand International.

                The doctor who was
                looking after Ibrahim Sorrie Bangua has travelled back to his native land. Sadly, Ibrahim Sorrie Bangua was left
                with no other ways to earn his livelihood and thus he chose to roam around Bombali District of Makeni City by
                begging for food, shelter and aid for medical treatment. On 20th August 2020, HHI West Africa President,
                Mr. Ibrahim Alpha Moigua went to Ibrahim Sorrie Bangua’s residence.

              Thereafter, HHI West Africa team had an agreement to provide all the expenses pertaining to Mr. Ibrahim Sorrie
              Bangua’s treatment. HHI West Africa President, Mr. Ibrahim Alpha Moigua personally came forward and took Ibrahim
              Sorrie Bangua to Freetown hospital. As estimated by HHI West Africa team, Two Million Sierra Leone Leones
              (203.78 USD) were spend by HHI West Africa on the surgeries and all the medical procedures. Further, a cheque
              of One Million Five Hundred Thousand Sierra Leone Leones (154.84 USD) were provided by HHI West Africa team to
              Ibrahim Sorrie Bangua’s family.

              The COVID-19 pandemic has left the world in a state of shock and distress. With no proper wages, more than half a
              million people working in the informal labour sector have been forced to stay hungry and travel back home. These
              labourers do not have access to basic sanitation needs and medicines amidst the pandemic. In a developing country
              like India, the informal labour sector has been badly hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. These migrant labourers need
              financial and psychological support amidst this COVID-19 pandemic.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div data-aos="fade-up" class="col-lg-6 program-details">
            <p>
              A proper supply of basic needs and medication to the migrant labourers is the need of the hour. We started
              distributing nutritional and energy-packed foods such as biscuits, bread, and rusk to the migrating labourers.
              We provided these migrant labourers with a 450 calorie meal which was cooked by a team of well-trained in-house
              cooks who follow standard operating procedures to maintain hygiene and quality protocols while working. We have
               worked in collaboration with the Government of Gujarat to find out places where these migrant labourers are
               struggling to get a single meal in order to provide them with the food packet. We also distributed masks and
               sanitizers to those who are in need. We did massive campaigns regarding the practice of social distancing norms
               and hygiene protocols amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.If a migrant labourer needs to travel to another state, the person would need a migratory pass.
            </p>

          <div data-aos="fade-up" class="col-lg-6 program-details">
            <p>
              Getting this migratory pass isn’t easy for a labourer who is illiterate. Our organization arranged migratory passes
              for 8000 labourers for travelling from Gujarat to Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Due to the pandemic, many people have
              lost their jobs with no more money to spend on health and sanitation. Keeping in view the whole pandemic situation,
              the Governments ordered to wear masks compulsorily, but the poor people have no money to buy food, and also
              procuring a mask isn't an easy task. So, our Helping Hand International Chandigarh,India team has come to help
              those people who cannot afford masks and sanitizers because of their poor economic status and arrange mask
              distribution drive in Mohali district of Punjab, India, so that we can prevent this infectious virus, Covid-19,
              from reaching people.

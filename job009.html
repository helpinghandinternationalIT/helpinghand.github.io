                                <p><strong>For Every Child, AN ADVOCATE:</strong></p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify">The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the
                                    rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in
                                    programmes, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most
                                    disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to
                                    children’s rights into action. For UNICEF, equity means that all children have an
                                    opportunity to survive, develop and reach their full potential, without
                                    discrimination, bias or favoritism. To the degree that any child has an unequal
                                    chance in life — in its social, political, economic, civic and cultural dimensions —
                                    her or his rights are violated. There is growing evidence that investing in the
                                    health, education and protection of a society’s most disadvantaged citizens —
                                    addressing inequity — not only will give all children the opportunity to fulfil
                                    their potential but also will lead to sustained growth and stability of countries.
                                    This is why the focus on equity is so vital. It accelerates progress towards
                                    realizing the human rights of all children, which is the universal mandate of
                                    UNICEF, as outlined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while also
                                    supporting the equitable development of nations.</p>

                    the bulk of the world's trading nations and ratified in their parliaments. The goal is to ensure
                    that

                    trade flows as smoothly, predictably, and freely as possible <br>
